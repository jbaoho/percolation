# percolation

This repository is a project from Princeton's Algorithms class. The aim of the project is to utilize the union-find data structure to determine whether a grid of sites can be percolated, meaning if there is a path connecting the top of the grid to the bottom. The program uses Princeton's weghted quick union-find library to discover if there is a path from top to bottom of an n-by-n dimension grid. The repository contains code for the project within the src file and files to test the functionality of the code as well.
